<h1><center>If I could travel anywhere</center></h1>
<font size="5">If I could travel anywhere I would  travel these three places first. They are:-</font><br>
<center><h2>Manali</h2></center>
<center><font size="5"><p>I would visit Manali because It is a rustic enclave known for its cool climate and snow-capped mountains,<br> offering respite to tourists escaping scorching heat of the plains. <br>The tourism industry in Manali started booming only in the early 20th century,<br> mainly because of its natural bounties and salubrious climate.</p></font></center>
<center><h2>West Bengal</h2></center>
<center><font size="5"><p>Top Attractions In West Bengal. West Bengal is home to some of the<br> most scenic landscapes and monuments of India. Include Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal,<br> while exploring West Bengal tourism and witness the <br>art galleries and historical monuments of this spellbinding city.</font></center>
<center><h2>Agra</h2></center>
<center><font size="5"><p>The Taj Mahal is one of the top reasons to visit Agra.<br>
But this city is houses architectural monuments such as Agra Fort and a small city called <br>Fatehpuri Sikri which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These structures, cuisine, architecture and shopping showcase the <br>Mughal influences from the fifteenth century.</font></center>
